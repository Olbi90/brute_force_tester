# An educational Codebreaker

## Version 1.0
This program is used to demonstrate password cracking. 

It currently has two modes. The first runs a simple **bruteforce** algorithm to guess a self-selected password. 
The second one carries out a **word list attack** to find out the password.

It is for educational purposes **only**.

## Requirements
Python 3.10.12 No external libraries or modules are required.

## Feature Updates
Planned features:
- better presentation of the results
- password guessing scenarios
- what comes in my mind while programming :blush:
